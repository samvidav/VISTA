# VISTA - Visualization of Interactions in Space and Time Analysis tool 

## Introduction

VISTA (Visualization of Interactions in Space and Time Analysis tool) is an interactive program for visualization and exploratory data analysis of dynamic protein-protein interaction (PPI) datasets. VISTA takes advantage of cutting-edge graph visualization algorithms and automatic programmatic access to protein databases to deliver an intuitive and user-friendly data visualization platform. The tool enables users to discover underlying patterns in multiple interaction networks across conditions using an interactive interface with dynamic network visuals and exploratory quantitative analysis. Users can integrate interaction networks of one or many baits, include subcellular localization information and functional annotations to modify networks, analyze dynamic quantitative properties of the network, and identify properties of proteins shared between multiple baits - all with their own data, with few manual steps. 

## Motivation

There is a growing need for integrated visualization and analysis of quantitative interaction data across different conditions and from multiple datasets. Comparing large-scale interactome changes and investigating trends in quantitative measurements of PPIs across conditions can drive novel hypotheses on biological functions. The inclusion of spatial proteomic information, such as subcellular localization, and functional classification via gene ontology enrichment and protein complex identification further increases the power of such assessments. 

We built VISTA to specifically address the spatially and temporally heterogenous proteome of the cell during viral infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Many of the example datasets packaged with the program draw on that data. However, VISTA can be applied to any PPI datasets with measurements across multiple conditions.
